        <h2>Why is Plastic Dangerous?</h2>
        <p>Plastic bags are one of the biggest environmental hazards in the world today. They are non-biodegradable, meaning they can take hundreds of years to break down. During this time, they pollute our ecosystems, land, and water. Below are the key reasons why plastic bags are dangerous:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wildlife Harm:</strong> Animals, especially marine creatures, mistake plastic bags for food, leading to choking, suffocation, or even death. Ingesting plastic also causes internal injuries.</li>
            <li><strong>Ocean Pollution:</strong> A large percentage of plastic bags end up in the ocean, where they harm marine life and create giant floating waste patches, like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil Contamination:</strong> When plastic bags are discarded improperly, they leach toxic chemicals into the soil, affecting plant life and entering the food chain.</li>
            <li><strong>Blockage of Drainage Systems:</strong> In urban areas, plastic bags often block storm drains, leading to flooding, especially during heavy rains.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Biodegradability:</strong> Unlike organic materials, plastic bags don't break down naturally. Instead, they break into tiny pieces known as microplastics, which further pollute the environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Government Policies on Plastic Bag Use</h2>
        <p>The Government of Pakistan has introduced several policies to curb plastic bag usage. Some cities, like Karachi and Lahore, have implemented partial bans on plastic bags, while others promote plastic-free alternatives. Despite these efforts, challenges remain in enforcing these laws nationwide, and the widespread use of plastic bags continues to be a problem. Nevertheless, the government is actively raising awareness through campaigns and supporting legislation to reduce plastic waste in the country.</p>

        <h2>Sustainable Alternatives to Plastic Bags</h2>
        <p>Pakistan has begun to explore and adopt more sustainable alternatives to plastic bags. Some viable options include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cloth Bags:</strong> Durable and reusable, cloth bags are an excellent substitute for plastic. They are widely available in stores and can be used for years.</li>
            <li><strong>Paper Bags:</strong> Used for packaging, paper bags decompose easily and are a more eco-friendly choice. Many grocery stores now offer paper bags as alternatives.</li>
            <li><strong>Reusable Jute Bags:</strong> Jute bags are strong, biodegradable, and can be reused multiple times, making them a great option for shopping and other purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Bioplastics:</strong> Made from renewable resources such as corn, bioplastics offer a biodegradable alternative to conventional plastic, reducing long-term environmental harm.</li>
        </ul>
